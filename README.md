# Team Communication Network Viewer
*This is supposed to be a code to plot relationships between colleagues within a team in a very visible manner*

## Motivation
Team communications is usually a recurring problem between colleagues, and sometimes only the qualitative perceptions aren't enough to identify possible problems and isolated professionals, leading to turnovers and bad teamwork. 

This tool is supposed to be a plotter for a technique applied within a large-sized company that follows the Spotify Organization Model (tribes and squads).

A communication matrix is built through HR research on self-declared connection perceptions between teammembers (columns), thus making rows the overall perceived communications from third parties within the same team.

This is highly valuable to assess if the team members are aware of their roles and importances, and identify strong and weak points to act locally. It is also possible to compare different team performances regarding this subject.
